I guess this would be the start of my blog. items here would mainly include coding, some random thoughts and devotional. would probably start with some old stuff 

why humble beginnings you might ask. I believe partially it is where i am now. being 29 years of age, the challengers that i face just keep getting increasingly harder. So i think its a good time to take a step back to reflect on where i am now, and where i get called to. (If i ever update this reguarly and look back on this)

what struggles do i face now? 
- back pains
- work fulfillment
- cash poor
- stonks are a rip
- struggles in confidence
- being relational
- temptations

currently im reading a book "what is god's will for my Life?" by John Ortberg and a strong point that its brought out from it was that god wants to shape us and not to fit us into circumstances.
What then is my life goal to be? are the struggles I face necessary to trust in God more? All through the bible is the recurring theme of relational > state

where will i be from this day forth? am i becoming more like him?

stay tunned...
